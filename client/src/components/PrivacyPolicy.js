        <h3>Withdrawal of Consent</h3>
        <p>Withdrawing your consent will not affect the legality of any processing that took place prior to such withdrawal. You may choose to stop sharing your health data on our App entirely by deactivating your account within the settings page of our App. Withdrawing your consent will mean you can no longer share status with any other users of our App: You will no longer see the status of any contacts you were sharing with and they will no longer be able to see yours.

        <h3>Change of purpose</h3>
        <p>We may use your data for any purpose that is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose we will update this policy outlining the new purpose and the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
        <h3>Data sharing through the App</h3>
        <p>Our App enables you to privately share your coronavirus status (health data) with contacts you choose. If both you and your contact agree to share status, then you are both able to see each other’s data. It is always a two-way deal, only if you can see their status can they see yours. Sharing of status occurs when you or your contact signs-up or logs-in via a personal link shared between you. Personal links are automatically generated within accounts on our App in order for you to invite your contacts to share your status.</p>
        <h3>Data sharing by us</h3>
        <p>We do not sell your data. We may share your data with third parties where required by law, to administer our relationship with you or to provide you with a service related to your use of our App such as IT or analytics, for example Google Analytics which reports website traffic. Google collects data which it shares with other Google services. You can opt-out of having your activity on the App made available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">here</a></p>

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or sale, your data may be transferred. We will provide notice before your data becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may need to share your data with our professional advisors, the authorities or the courts in certain situations. For example to enforce our rights or to defend ourselves against claims made against us or to investigate (suspected) wrongdoings or to protect the users of our App. Where the law permits, we may also share your anonymized data without your knowledge or consent.</p>
        <h3>Third party sites</h3>
        <p>Our App may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy notice of every site you visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
        <h3>Data security</h3>

        <h3>Transfer of data</h3>
        <p>Your data may be transferred to, and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ to those from your jurisdiction. No transfer of your data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

        <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes. You can update your data in your account settings via our App.</p>
        <h3>Accessing your own data</h3>

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that your data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
